# sql_zomato_analysis_p3

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Zomato analysis  
**Database**: Zomato_analysis_p3

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.
## Objectives

1. **Set up a zomato sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `Zomato_analysis_p3`.
- **Table Creation**: 
```sql
create database Zomato_analysis_p3;

create table customers(
customer_id	varchar(10) primary key,
customer_name varchar(50),	
reg_date date
);

create table restaurants(
restaurant_id varchar(10) primary key,
restaurant_name	varchar(50),
city varchar(20),
opening_hours varchar(50)
);

create table riders (
rider_id varchar(10) primary key,
rider_name varchar(30),
sign_up date
);

create table orders(

order_id varchar(10) primary key,
customer_id	varchar(10),
restaurant_id varchar(10),
order_item varchar(60),
order_date date,	
order_time time,
order_status varchar(55),
total_amount float,
foreign key (customer_id) references customers(customer_id),
foreign key (restaurant_id) references restaurants(restaurant_id)
);


create table deliveries (

delivery_id	varchar(10) primary key,
order_id varchar(10),
delivery_status	varchar(40),
delivery_time time,
rider_id varchar(10),
foreign key (order_id) references orders(order_id),
foreign key (rider_id) references riders(rider_id)
);

```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
select count(*) from customers
where customer_name is null 
or 
reg_date is null ;

select count(*) from restaurants
where restaurant_name is null
or city is null
or opening_hours is null;

select count(*) from orders
where order_item is null 
or order_date is null
or order_time is null
or order_status is null
or total_amount is null;


select count(*) from riders
where rider_name is null
or sign_up is null;


select * from deliveries
where delivery_status is null
or delivery_time is null;
    
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

# Conclusion
This Zomato SQL Analysis Project successfully demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to clean, analyze, and extract valuable insights from food delivery data. Through structured database design, data cleaning, and advanced SQL queries, we uncovered critical business insights such as:

Customer Behavior Trends â€“ Identified top-spending customers, most frequently ordered dishes, and inactive users.
Operational Efficiency â€“ Analyzed peak ordering times, order cancellations, and delivery performance.
Revenue Insights â€“ Ranked restaurants by revenue, tracked monthly sales trends, and evaluated customer lifetime value.
Rider & Restaurant Growth â€“ Assessed rider earnings and restaurant growth ratios over time.

These insights can help Zomato and similar food delivery platforms enhance their customer experience, optimize restaurant partnerships, and streamline logistics. By continuously refining data-driven strategies, businesses can improve efficiency, maximize revenue, and stay competitive in the evolving food delivery industry.
